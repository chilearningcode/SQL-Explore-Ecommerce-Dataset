## üìå Background & Overview  

### Objective:
### üìñ What is this project about? 
 
> This project utilizes advanced SQL techniques to analyze an e-commerce dataset to identify sales trends and customer segments, ultimately aiding in strategic marketing and informed business decisions.  

### üë§ Who is this project for?  


‚û°Ô∏è **Marketing Manager** who want to understand the customer segmentation. 

###  ‚ùìBusiness Questions:  

- Analyze data on items, sales, order quantities, growth rates, top categories, top territories, and total discount costs by subcategories.
- Assess customer retention rates, stock level trends, month-over-month differences, and stock-to-sales ratios.
- Evaluate the number and value of pending orders in 2014.

### üéØProject Outcome:  

- **Sales and Growth Trends**: Bike Racks and Road Frames achieved the highest sales revenue and quantity, respectively. Mountain Frames and Socks showed notable year-over-year growth.
- **Discounts and Customer Retention**: Helmets had continuous discount promotions with increased discount costs from 2012 to 2013, while customer retention dropped significantly after the first purchase, indicating the need for better retention strategies.
- **Stock and Order Management**: Stock levels consistently decreased each quarter, suggesting strong sales. High pending order counts highlight the necessity of revamping the order process to drive higher sales revenue.

```
|Row	|yr|Status|order_cnt|value
|-|-|-|-|-
|1	|2014|1|224|3873579.0123000029

üí° The high number of pending orders highlights the need to **revamp the order process**. Doing so can help reduce pending orders and drive higher sales revenue.

## üîé Final Conclusion & Recommendations  

This SQL project, through its analysis of the AdventureWorks dataset, provided several valuable business insights:

- **Revenue and Quantity Sales**: Identifying Bike Racks with the highest sales revenue and Road Frames with the highest quantity sales informed inventory and marketing strategies to meet strong market demand. Notable year-over-year growth in Mountain Frames and Socks highlighted growth opportunities.
- **Monthly and Yearly Trends**: Tracking sales trends month-over-month and year-over-year revealed seasonal patterns and growth rates. This enabled businesses to optimize promotional activities, align inventory management, and allocate resources more efficiently.
- **Customer and Order Management**: Insights into customer retention emphasized the need for improved retention strategies. Observing stock quantity trends and the high number of pending orders underscored the importance of effective inventory and order process management to boost sales revenue.

Overall, this project demonstrated the power of data-driven strategies in optimizing business operations and making informed decisions, enhancing SQL skills, and showcasing the practical applications of data analysis in a business context.











































































































# [SQL] Explore E-commerce Dataset | Analyze Website's Performance
## I. Introduction 
### Overview
This project leveraged SQL to analyze a comprehensive e-commerce dataset, providing actionable insights for marketing and sales strategy development. By using Google Big Querry for querying and aggregating key metrics, this analysis will identify sales trends, customer segmentation opportunities, and effective marketing campaign targets, ultimately supporting informed decision-making and improved business performance.

### Dataset Access 
The ga_sessions e-commerce dataset, available on BigQuery, provides comprehensive session data from the Google Merchandise Store for detailed analysis and SQL practice. To access the dataset, follow these steps:

- Log in to your Google Cloud Platform account and create a new project.
- Navigate to the BigQuery console and select your newly created project.
- In the navigation panel, select "Add Data" and then choose "Search a project".
- Enter the project ID **"bigquery-public-data.google_analytics_sample.ga_sessions"** and click "Enter".
- Click on the **"ga_sessions_"** table to open it.

## II. Insight
- **Traffic and Bounce rate**: Google drives the highest traffic but also high on bounce rate, while (direct) traffic source has the best performace with lowest bounce rate also the highest revenue.
- **Customer Behavior**: users who made purchases were likely to make multiple transactions within the same month. On Juny 2017, *"Google Sunglasses"* were the most popular item purchased by customers who bought the *"YouTube Men's Vintage Henley"*
- **Conversion rate**: has increased over month, indicating growing user engagement with products.

## III. Eploring the Dataset 
### Apply Problem Solving 

| Understand Problem | Break it down into smaller pieces | Ideate | Implement and Review 
|-|-|-|-
| Which to be calculated (sum, count, ratio, etc.) and grouped? <br> Does it needs any filter (time, conditions, etc.)? | Which tables have data that I want to get? <br> Which columns have data corresponded to the problem? <br> Can I get the data I by one step, if not, break down even smaller? | How many step did I need to get the final result? <br> Is it optimized? | 

### Implement Step 
#### Query 01: calculate total visit, pageview, transaction for Jan, Feb and March 2017 (order by month)
```sql
SELECT DISTINCT 
  format_date("%Y%m",parse_date("%Y%m%d", date)) as month 
  , count(totals.visits) as visits 
  , sum(totals.pageviews) as pageviews
  , sum(totals.transactions) as transactions 
FROM `bigquery-public-data.google_analytics_sample.ga_sessions_2017*`
WHERE _table_suffix between '0101' and '0331' 
GROUP BY 1
ORDER BY 1;
```
| Row | month | visits | pageviews | transactions |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| 1 | 201701 | 64694 | 257708 | 713 |
| 2 | 201702 | 62192 | 233373 | 733 |
| 3 | 201703 | 69931 | 259522 | 993 |

Pageviews are relatively stable, with a slight dip in February but recovering in March. Transactions consistently increase over the three months, with a significant jump in March. <br> 
The data suggests an upward trend in user engagement and transactions as the quarter progresses, which could be due to promotional activities or seasonal factors.

#### Query 02: Bounce rate per traffic source in July 2017 (Bounce_rate = num_bounce/total_visit) (order by total_visit DESC)
```sql 
SELECT DISTINCT
  trafficSource.source
  , count(totals.visits) total_visits
  , count(totals.bounces) total_no_of_bounces
  , round(count(totals.bounces)*100.0 /count(totals.visits), 3) bounce_rates
FROM `bigquery-public-data.google_analytics_sample.ga_sessions_201707*` -- filter for year and month directly in FROM statement 
GROUP BY 1
ORDER BY 2 desc, 3 desc;
```
| Row | source | total_visits | total_no_of_bounces | bounce_rates |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| 1 | google | 38400 | 19798 | 51.557	| 
| 2 | (direct) | 19891 | 8606 | 43.266 |
| 3 | youtube.com | 6351 | 4238 | 66.73 |
| 4 | analytics.google.com | 1972 | 1064 | 53.955 |
| 5 | Partners | 1788 | 936 | 52.349 |
| 6 | m.facebook.com | 669 | 430 | 64.275 |
| 7 | google.com | 368 | 183 | 49.728 |
| 8 | ... |

Google drives the highest traffic but also high on bounce rate. YouTube and Facebook have the highest bounce rate (>60), while (direct) traffic shows better engagement (<40). <br> 
Consider focusing on sources with lower bounce rates.

#### Query 3: Revenue by traffic source by week, by month in June 2017
```sql
WITH  
  month_data as (
    SELECT  
      'Month' as time_type 
      ,format_date("%Y%m",parse_date("%Y%m%d", date)) as time -- fixed

      ,round(sum(product.productRevenue) /1000000, 4) as revenue
    FROM `bigquery-public-data.google_analytics_sample.ga_sessions_201706*` ,
    UNNEST (hits) hits
    ,UNNEST (hits.product) product
    WHERE product.productRevenue is not null 
    GROUP BY 1,2,3
    ORDER BY 4 desc
  )
  , week_data as (
    SELECT DISTINCT

      ,trafficSource.source as source
      ,round(sum(product.productRevenue) /1000000, 4) as revenue
    FROM `bigquery-public-data.google_analytics_sample.ga_sessions_201706*`, 
    UNNEST (hits) hits
    ,UNNEST (hits.product) product
    WHERE product.productRevenue is not null 
    GROUP BY 1,2,3,4
